# docs/content

This is the MkDocs **content root**. Everything here is published.

## Layout
- `_starter/` — minimal onboarding pages
- `architecture/` — architecture & engineering decisions
- `api/` — API docs derived from `contracts/`
- `guides/` — contributor guides
- `tech-runbooks/` — technical runbooks

## Conventions
- Use **relative links**.
- Prefer `##` and `###` headings; keep `#` only for page title.
- Include a **Verification** section for anything that changes runtime behavior.
- When referencing runbooks, link to `tech-runbooks/...`.
